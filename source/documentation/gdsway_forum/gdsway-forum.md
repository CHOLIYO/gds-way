# The GDS Way Forum

This site documents some of the decisions agreed at the GDS Way Forum about the products we operate.

The GDS Forum meets once a month. The Forum is lead developers and technical architects representing GDS programmes who are responsible for communicating and implementing the GDS Way.

The Forum reviews:

* all GDS Way open and closed PRs
* expired guidance and if it should be continued
* possible subject areas and ownership of new content
