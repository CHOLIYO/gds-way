# The GDS Way

The GDS Way documents the specific technology, tools and processes that GDS teams use to build and operate services. It's not intended as guidance for anyone working outside GDS, you'll find that in the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual).

The GDS Way shares agreed ways of working so service teams benefit from:

* using similar tools
* central procurement
* cost savings as new teams will be cheaper to spin up
