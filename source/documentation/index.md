# The GDS Way

The GDS Way documents the specific technology, tools and processes that GDS teams use to build and operate services. It's not intended as guidance for anyone working outside GDS, you'll find that in the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual).

The GDS Way shares agreed ways of working so service teams benefit from:

* using similar tools
* central procurement
* cost savings as new teams will be cheaper to spin up

The GDS Way makes it easier for projects to get started while still giving teams flexibility to do something different if their project needs it. The GDS Way includes consistent:

* terminology
* ways of working
* technology and tools
* measures

All decisions are made in alignment with [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) which covers service design more broadly.

Products at GDS in discovery or alpha development phases must [follow instructions set out in the Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery) and also have the option to follow the standards in this repository.

Products in beta and live phases must follow both the [instructions set out in the Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery) and the guidance in this repository.
