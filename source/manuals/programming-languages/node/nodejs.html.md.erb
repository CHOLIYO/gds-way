## Important Note Concerning use of Node.js at GDS

No new projects at GDS should use Node.js without prior consultation with the Deputy Director Technology Operations.
The [programming language recommendations](../standards/programming-languages.html) section has more detail on how we currently use Node.js at GDS and why this decision has been made.

## About this manual

This manual is designed to aid developers in writing Node.js code that is clear and consistent, within, and across,
projects at GDS.

It is intended also as a location to collect identified best practices in Node.js development from across GDS.

## Guidance

As with all Javascript at GDS, for Node.js applications we use the [standard] style.

When writing server-side Javascript for Node.js, there can be additional considerations on-top of those covered by the [standard] style.
These can be found in the [GDS Node.js Style Guide][GDSNSG] in this manual.

As always the rules in the [GDS Node.js Style Guide][GDSNSG] should be followed only in conjunction with the advice
on consistency on the main [programming languages manual page][GDSPL].

If you want to add guidance on Node.js please create a pull request against this repo.


## Testing

_For more on Node.js testing see the [testing][testing] section of this manual._

We use mocha and chai's `expect` assertion style for Node.js testing at GDS.


## Updating this manual

This manual, and by extension the [GDS Node.js Style Guide][GDSNSG], is not presumed to be infallible or beyond dispute.
If you think something is missing or if you'd like to see something changed then:

1. _(optional)_ Start with the [#frontend][slack-frontend] community's Slack channel. See what other developers think and you'll get an idea
of how likely your proposal is of being accepted as a pull request even before you put in any work.
2. Check out the making changes section of the [GDS Tech repo][github-gds-tech-readme-making-changes]
3. Create a pull request against [GDS Tech repo][github-gds-tech]
