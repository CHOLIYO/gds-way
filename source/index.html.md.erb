title: The GDS Way
---

# <%= current_page.data.title %>

The GDS Way documents the specific technology, tools and processes that GDS teams use to build and operate services. 

If you're from another government department, you can find official guidance about building services in the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual). We publish the GDS way because we believe that there's [value in working in the open](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better). If you're working in these areas we welcome your [comments, contribution and discussion](link to contribution guide which has an explicit guidance for x-gov contributions).


Questions...

### better readme/contribution guidance
- who has authority to make changes?
- is it mandatory or not?
- how does content get removed?
- how does content get proposed?

### scope
- vs service manual
- is it just for technologists (eg. PM/DMs should be involved in tech debt discussions)
- some sections seem specific to a particular programme


It's not intended as guidance for anyone working outside GDS - you'll find that in the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual).

## About The GDS Way

The GDS Way shares agreed ways of working so service teams benefit from:

* using similar tools
* central procurement
* costs savings as new teams will be cheaper to spin up

The GDS Way makes it easier for projects to get started while still giving teams flexibility to do something different if their project needs it.

The GDS Way includes consistent:

* terminology
* ways of working
* technology and tools
* measures

All decisions are made in alignment with [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) which covers service design more broadly.

Products at GDS in discovery or alpha development phases must [follow instructions set out in the Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery) and also have the option to follow the standards in this repository.

Products in beta and live phases must follow both the [instructions set out in the Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery) and the standards in this repository.

## Ways of working

GDS works on the highest priorities while supporting its live services and adjusting its plans when priorities change. To do this GDS uses agile at scale to plan and carry out its work in a quarterly planning cycle, find out:

- [how GDS uses quarterly planning](../ways-of-working/quarterly-planning.html)

## Standards

Standards are based on formal decisions made by the [GDS Way Forum](#the-gds-way-forum) and have an expiry date. Expiry dates ensure decisions are reviewed to check their continued relevance for GDS.

### Incident management

Incident management at GDS focuses on restoring operations as quickly as possible. Find out how:

- [GDS provides user support](standards/user-support.html) for service teams and users
- [to manage technical incidents](standards/incident-management.html) for your service

## Manuals

Manuals are informative guides, not necessarily based on any formal decision or standard:

- [programming language style guides](manuals/programming-languages.html)
- [setting up logging](manuals/logging.html)
- [licensing](manuals/licensing.html)
- [how to review code](manuals/code-review-guidelines.html)
- [accessibility](manuals/accessibility.html)
- [writing READMEs](manuals/readme-guidance.html)

## How to add new guidance

Contribute to this repository by making a pull request in [GitHub](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-way) for discussion at the GDS Way Forum.

You can also read the service manual to find out about
[learning about and writing user needs](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs).

Thank you for your contributions as we develop this repository.

### Submission template

When you create a new Markdown file follow this pattern and then make a pull request:

```markdown
---
title: Thing you're writing a standard about
last_reviewed_on: yyyy-mm-dd
review_in: 6 months
---

# <%%= current_page.data.title %>

Introduction of a couple of paragraphs to explain why the thing you're
writing a standard about is important.

## User needs

Why do we do this thing? Who is it helping?

## Principles

What broad approaches do we follow when we do this thing?

## Tools

What specific bits of software (commercial or open source) do
we use to help us do this thing?
```

## The GDS Way Forum

This site documents some of the decisions agreed at the GDS Way Forum about the products we operate.

The GDS Forum meets once a month. The Forum is lead developers and technical architects representing GDS programmes who are responsible for communicating and implementing the GDS Way.

The Forum reviews:

* all GDS Way open and closed PRs
* expired guidance and if it should be continued
* possible subject areas and ownership of new content
