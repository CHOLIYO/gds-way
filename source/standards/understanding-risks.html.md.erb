When you build, maintain or change your service you must have a clear understanding of any associated risks because they will impact your service design and affect your users.

You should work with the [Information Assurance (IA) team] to design appropriate solutions to your service's risks. IA may need to obtain risk acceptance from your Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO), for example if your service needs offshoring approval.

The Service Manual has some recommendations that can reduce risk to your service, for example how to:

* [protect against fraud] when you design and manage your service
* [secure your information] if you handle ‘official’ classified data

## Model security threats

Modelling threats can help you gain a clearer understanding of threats against your service.

There is a [threat modelling manual] available and the [Cyber Security team] can provide further guidance and support in the workshops.

## Further Reading

The [National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)] provides guidance about cybersecurity. The Service Manual has advice about [securing your information] and [securing your cloud environment].
